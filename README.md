Project Description: Using Python, perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys.  Provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes.
You will be following the Exploratory Data Analysis process to provide these recommendations over the next month. There are 4 parts, including creating data study questions, cleaning the dataset, analyzing and visualizing the data, and improving plots.

Here are the 4 questions this analysis is trying to answer:
What goals & motivations do students have when going into Computer Science related degrees and classes?
What computing majors are students most interested in, and what majors are they not interested in?
Looking at the latest survey results (2023) from both the Majors and Non-Majors surveys, what are the race/ethnicity demographic differences between the Majors and Non-Majors respondents?
Look at the records of just the Non-Computing Majors taking Computing Major classes. This group includes: Challenger, ShareTime, Non-Degree Seeking, Undecided and all those who selected Other.  What is the interest level for taking another computing class? Show a bar chart with the count for each interest level.
